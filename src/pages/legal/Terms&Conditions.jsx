                        <h2>What is Venomart :</h2>

                        <p>
                            Venomart is a distributed application that runs on the Venom network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to create, buy, transfer and trade unique digital goods (artwork, collectibles, tickets…). Using Venomart, users can view their digital goods and use the Smart Contracts to create, acquire, and trade with other users.
                        </p>

                        <p>Smart-Contract Enabled.  The Digital Goods on Venomart is represented on smart contracts on the Venom blockchain that provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on Venomart (“Smart Contracts”).  This means that all Digital Goods are outside of the control of any one party, including Venomart, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties.  We neither own nor control MetaMask, the Venom network, your browser, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the Platform. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.  The User understands that your Venom public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Platform. </p>

                        <p>
                            Noncustodial.  While Venomart offers a marketplace for Digital Goods, it does not buy, sell, or ever take custody or possession of any Digital Goods. Neither Venom nor the Platform are custodians of any Digital Goods. You affirm that you are aware and acknowledge that Venomart is a non-custodial provider of software services that has developed this distributed and decentralized environment where the App can be autonomously and directly accessed by the Users without any involvement or actions taken by Venomart or any third-party. As a marketplace, Venomart cannot make any representation or guarantee that Creators will achieve any particular outcome as the result of listing their Digital Artwork and collectibles on Venomart.
